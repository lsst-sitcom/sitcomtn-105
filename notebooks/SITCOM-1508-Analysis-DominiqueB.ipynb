    "# Compare TMA balancing data from previous events with the next events\n",
    "\n",
    "We are getting ready to balance the telescope twice in the next weeks. First, we will balance the telescope with ComCam and M2 Glass. The M2 Glass and M2 Surrogate have similar weights, with a small difference. We expect the torques applied by the elevation drives will be very close to the previous balancing event(s). A couple of weeks later, we will repeat the procedure with ComCam, M2 Glass, and M1M3 Glass. The M1M3 Glass and M1M3 Cell assembly is much heavier than the M1M3 Mass Simulator (yellow cross) and hundreds of kilograms heavier than the M1M3 Surrogate and M1M3 Cell configuration. This procedure will be much more delicate due to the size and mass of the mirror.\n",
